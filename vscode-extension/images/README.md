# Extension Icon

This directory should contain the extension icon file:
- icon.png (128x128 pixels recommended)

The icon should represent PHP code analysis and security scanning functionality.

For now, the extension will work without an icon, but one should be added before publishing to the marketplace.

Suggested icon design elements:
- PHP logo or stylized "PHP" text
- Shield or security symbol
- Magnifying glass or search symbol
- Blue/green color scheme for trustworthiness

Example icon names:
- icon.png
- yc-pca-icon.png
- php-security-icon.png
